    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I have spent the last decade working for Godaddy. I started in the sales and tech support department and worked my way 
    into the wed design department. Customer consultations lead to developing new processes for our customers. After many 
    years on the frontline, I transitioned into the QA department and spent my time reviewing the websites that we made for 
    our customers</p>

    <p>While working at Godaddy, I returned to my first love of art. I started by painting as a release after a long day of 
    chasing sales goals. Painting got my creative juices flowing and lead me to a camera to get more instant gradification. 
    In learing how my camera worked and what boundries I could push it to, I challenged myself too a 365 photo project. After 
    a year of taking pictures everyday, I had really tested the limites and was looking for a new release.</p>

    <p>About a year after I finished up my photo project, I was brought into a podcast team to help with images and video. At the 
    time, I had no video experience and set myself with a new challege. In learning to create video content, I also quickly became 
    a co-host for the podcast.</p>
