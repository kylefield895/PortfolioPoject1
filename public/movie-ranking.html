        <h3>Kill Bill Vol. 2</h3>
          <p>As the second in the series, the story of how Beatric Kiddo became an assasin was my favorite part of the series. 
        Although Vol. 1 was full of violence, Vol. 2 provided more storytelling.</p> 
        <h3>Fight Club</h3>
          <p>The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about fight club.</p>
        <h3>Dazed and Confused</h3>
          <p>If this isn't the best "coming of age" story, I don't know what is. Party at the Moontower.</p>
